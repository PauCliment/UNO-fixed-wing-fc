# Arduino-Based UAV Flight Controller

A lightweight, robust, and real-time flight control system designed for small fixed-wing UAVs, implemented on an Arduino UNO R4 Minima. This project enables fly-by-wire control of the aircraft's attitude, enhancing flight stability and ease of operation under external disturbances.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Implement a real-time attitude stabilization controller on a small UAV.
- Assist pilots during flight by reducing control workload and improving stability.
- Reject disturbances such as wind gusts using onboard sensor feedback and control algorithms.

## 🧠 System Overview

The system runs on a custom flight computer built around an **Arduino UNO R4 Minima** and a dedicated **sensor board**. The board includes:

- IMU sensors for attitude estimation
- SD card module for data logging
- Status LED
- Interfaces for actuator outputs and RC receiver inputs
- Power distribution for onboard electronics

The Arduino-based controller interprets RC commands, estimates aircraft attitude, and computes control actions to achieve the commanded orientation while maintaining stability.
